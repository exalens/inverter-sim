# Inverter Simulator
# A simple OPC-UA Inverter simulator for testing Process Endpoint Monitoring

The process simulates an inverter device with various operational modes. The server provides an interface to interact with the inverter parameters and supports external communication through a TCP server. The inverter's behavior, represented by variables such as power and temperature, can be dynamically updated via OPC UA clients or external systems.

# To activate the OPC-UA Inverter Simulator ensure all Python requirements are installed, and run:

<code>python3 inverter.py</code>

This will execute the OPC-UA server that publishes data from inverter simulation on the IP of the current host (e.g., 0.0.0.0).

# To activate the simulator process, run: 

<code>python3 client.py</code>

A menu will appear to allow you to set the operating mode of the inverter and change the inverter process variables.
You can use any OPC-UA client to connect to the OPC-UA server (no authentication is required) and start reading legitimate and anomalous process data generated by the simulation.
